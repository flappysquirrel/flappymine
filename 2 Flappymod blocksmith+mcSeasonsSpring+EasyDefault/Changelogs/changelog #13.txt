- Updated to 1.5.1

- Fixed all greenish hue to everything that contained wood and applied a hue that is 
taken from the default in order to have a default look. aka made wood look like wood again.
This contains fixes for: oak wood, oak wood planks, chests, ladders, crafting table,
 wood door, levers, torches, redstone torches, all types of rail track, signs, pistons, beds, ext.

- Altered Nether Quartz ore to even further have a more refined pattern. 
On a side note it kinda looks like bones... yea

- COMPLETLY revamped Gold, Emerald, and Diamond blocks into what I like to call Wealth blocks.
 I felt that the default style looked nothing like they should. they should
 represent your wealth and deserve nothing but amazing textures and
 I feel I represented that within these new textures. Gold, Emerald, and Diamond blocks now
 have a sub pattern so that they work well in large quantities next to each other. You can also
 mix and match them and it will still look fine because the sub pattern is the same within each.
 Lastly each has a very important frame around the block which helps unifying each one so your
 wealth is properly represented. This is some of my best changes to this texture pack
 And it looks fantastic ingame.

- Reduced the contrast within Nether rack. this should look much better when
 viewed in large quantities like for example within the nether. And with that Matched the backing
 of Nether Quartz to match.

- Gave Soulsand a creeper face... woot

- Fixed Mycelium side with dirt to match the other dirt textures

- Changes to the noteblock. the small pattern was of greenish hue so I changed it to a greyish-red

- Altered Dector rail to look more defined. Cleaned it up a bit

- Cleaned up rails. Increased the contrast on the Railtracks to have them match the default texture.

- Changed all glass to have dark navy frames. This was a very dificult desition to make since it
 strays from the default. But ultimatly I believe it has a much more usefull look for builds.

- (Unconfirmed) Fixed The purple-pinkish water when used with mods.

- Fixed cactus bottom to seem more rounded.

- Recolored cake to have the rich default colores and white frosting.

- Carrots growth stem was reverted to the default colores however fully grown carrots are unchanged.

- The top of Cauldrons now have a darker rim like in default.

- Revamped the colored cloth blocks. should be easier to use them with buildings now.

- Comparators now have a more improved look based on the default styling.

- Crops now have a more default look while growing up until the last 3 stages where you can see 
 more drastic changes into its final color of golden brown weat. This has more utility than default 
 and will drasticly help players to know when its done. All while looking good.

- The top of the daylight dector block had two pixels out of order in the pattern...
 my ocd made me fix it.

- The green hue ive been fixing in all the wood im noticing within all the block that have dirt
 UGH... fixed and returned all things with dirt Including the main menu background.

- Removed the dispencers visual crossbow since I got no positive feedback from it. Gave it a
 revamp of the default texture, it looks really nice.

- Iron doors were completly redone. They now feature new details with a better light gradient.
 this makes them prime for refrigerators.

- Furnace holes got more rounded and look better up close. I also put the frame around them like
 the side of the furnace has one. No idea why they made it like that.

- Soulsand also had a greenish tint when compared to the default.
 fixed to be colored more brown like default. Not that being brown colored is bad. >.>

- Also gave one of the faces in soulsand a spine... eek

- Nether Rack also got a recolor.. it had a purple hue but that was intended by me.
 switched it up to be more red, and by more I mean its blood red.

 default grass texture.

- Random green pixel on jungle leaves... wierd

- glowstone lamps had their color fixed back to default.

- Sugar cane got some touch ups. More saturation, and color balance betwene lime and yellow.

- The rose actually looks like a rose... no really take a look.
 Im really proud that I could get it to look that good being the same size and color as the default.

 this is to give the user a more arid and beaming sun feel.

- I scrapped my grass and shortened the defaults. Tall grass is now known as Half grass.

- Changed grass sides to grey. when holding a grassblock it will apear grey but will now accept
 proper biome coloring in the world. I consider this a triumph untill they fix this bug.

- Enchanting table corners now have the diamond block's color.

- Moved the block distroying anamation up one pixel to be centered.

- Enchanting Gui has be cleaned up a bit to match the colors of the enchanting table.

- Added an Alternates.png so the user can chose which one they like.

- cleaned the gui of the main menu and the action bar ingame. 
 The actionbar selection is now diamond colored to be more themed and visible.

- Main Menu minecraft title swapped out for a greatly higher resolution image. Minecraft sizes the
 image down perfectly to give the same feel no matter what resolution your using.

- The grain on the main menu buttons and the action bar in game were all removed.

- Clouds now have hidden enemy mob's faces within them. See if you can find them all.

- Cleaned up the experience bar to be more vibrant and green.

- Changed crosshair to a dot.

- Changed "No Signal strength" icon in the server list to just be red bars.

- Complete Recreation of all types of sandstone to better match and co exist with sand.
 The sandstone blocks now build extremly well with sand and have a much cleener cut.

- Inline pixel redraw of the crack designs within Sandstone_side. These redraws will improve/fix
 how sandstone looks side by side, and how it looks side by side with the other smooth sandstone blocks.

- Added the text files for the fire, lava, lava flow, water, water flow, and portal amamation orders.

- Switched NeatherQuartz ore with one of the Alternates so that it actually looks like an Ore.
 Tho the previous one had much more detail, it looked out of place.

- Changed the Dark Navy Blue glass frames to a soft gradient white-blue. I cant seem to make up my mind
 on which looks better. The Navy glass is in the Alternates.

- Cleaned up Repeaters to look well... cleaner and cooler.
 I also gave them marks to diferentiate tick levels at more of a distance.

- Switched Leaves with the default leaves that have a slightly reduced contrast.
 I felt my leaves were too different from default, and maintaining that look is very important.

- I gave Cauldron's better shading so they look more round.

- Changed Diamond armor and all diamond items to match the diamond ore colors which is a shade more blue.

 As it turns out with testing, its incredibly usefull for hiding and most players walk right past you.

- Completly Replaced all Default paintings with All Custom made new Minecraft pixed art paintings!

- I gave gold blocks more of an orangy shadow to match the ore. Now it looks even more like gold.

 I also added a Frame like all the other Compressed blocks ie:
 (gold/iron/redstone/emerald/diamond/lapis/ And Now Coal!)

- Added coald block without a frame for an alternate texture.

- Went back to Dropers and made the hole a rectangle to further differentiate betwene dispencers.
 Also as an added bonus it matches the default, so thats something.

 Mmm golden wheaty brown!
