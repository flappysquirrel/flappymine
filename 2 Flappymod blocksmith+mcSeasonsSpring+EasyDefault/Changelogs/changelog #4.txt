- Fixes and updates the following textures (pattern fixes): 
Sand, Crafting table, Mycelium, Jungle leaves, Snow, Leavers, Ladders,
 Diamond blocks, and Gold blocks.

- The sand texture had a unintended repeating line of pixels, so it was fixed
 and reworked upon that. Sand now has a more frequent rolling slightly grainy
 texture that meshes well in large quantities.
