- Changed and revamped the stone texture to be less repetitive 
in larger quantities and reduced visual static at even greater distances.

- As a result to changing stone I had to rematch all the ores with 
the new stone texture behind each cluster, so they would flow when naturally occurring within stone.

- Altered all types of wood planks. Lightened and saturated the dark outlines between planks to
 further reduce the Moire effect viewed from long distances.

- I noticed that mojang messed up neather brick on the bottom row 
(bottom last brick pattern needed to be moved left 2 pixels) Fixed it to make more sense and for the sake of my OCD, 
Also improved pattern meshing and shading to work well in larger quantities, 
Along with improving the bevel to have a more defined look like actual bricks.

- I darkened and saturated vibrance of the grass on the side of dirt, as it does not seem to accept proper biome coloring
Will have to look further into it but this edit should suffice for now.
