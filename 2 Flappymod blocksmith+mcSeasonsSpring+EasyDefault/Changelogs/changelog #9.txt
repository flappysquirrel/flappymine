- Arrows look slightly more sleek now, when flying through air.

- Chests had this greenish hue to them, which was unintended.
 Fixed so that have the same colors as the default textures,
 while also maintaining their smooth look.

- Boats Finally got some touch ups. they also use to have this greenish hue,
 again unintended. Fixed and cleaned up to be smooth.
