- Completly remade a brand new Panoram for the main menu. This time its actually made with EasyDefault!
Tho it was also shoved into photoshop and came out as a beautiful filtered mess. Just the way I like.

- Vastly Reduced the size Of the files. After rounding around 20 MB I feel like something had to be done.
I managed to put the texture pack on a diet and bring it to 5 MB which is 1/4 of what it was.

- (Bug found by: seasea128) Horse health textures missing completly. Changes to icons.png include the following
 * Empty Heart canisters given concaved shading
 * Hearts recreated pixel by pixel with my own shading not used on the other hearts. All hearts retain heart shape.
 * Poisned hearts now have green goo mostly covering heart.
 * Wither plagued hearts are charrd red as if burnt and withered.
 * Golden appled hearts now aquire Avarice and are mostly covered in gold colored from golden apples.
 * Hardcore mode hearts now are bleeding in the shape of the hardcore emblem heart. wow so hardcore.
 * We have had iron armor for just way to long. Upgraded to diamond!
 * Also Armor has proper hand created shading as well as the empty armor slots.
 * Horse Health Missing and thanks to seasea128 now its found and added!
 * I think horse hearts were actually saddles turned sideways, with iron sturups. Shaded and recolored.
 * Horse jump bar was smothed recolored and had its vibrance increased. baisically given the xp treatment.
 * Internet connection and ping bars are altered to... look cooler now I guess. Whatever I like it.

- Pack.png was updated to fit the new version 15. 
Now people will feel more inclined to select EasyDefault over others.

- Both Pistion tops Sticky & Normal were redone with a new style that stands out from default while looking cool.
Couldn't turn my head away any longer looking at the boken pattern on pistons. OCD tendancys Rejoyce!
Sticky Piston goo also has the slime block pattern in it.

- I could not decide which Sticky goo to use on the Sticky piston. 
I had made a cool circle pattern but couldn't see how it could be used for table decoration
(the alternate use for sticky pistons). So I made a goo smudge as well and put the circle goo in alternates.

- Complete recolor on Brick blocks. I seemed way to orange and needed to feel like a overcast day in Boston.
The overall brightness of the block was reduced and redness was increased, becuse bricks are red generally.
Also bricks tend to alternate color every once in a while so I brought in an alternating color brick. Lookin Good.
(old bricks thrown in alternates)

- I am STILL finding blocks that cought the random green blotches... its not easy to spot because its sooooooo
barely visible. Fixed the green hue on the bottom of stonebrick. 

- I Made a brick like variant for Stonebrick that I put in alternates. 
It looks good I just think it strays from default too much. Go check it out or try it out. whichever.

- Sand cought the green bug.. color adjusted ever so slightly away from green. 
I Hope that my eyes arnt going and started failing to pick up all other colores besides green.

- Sandstone's texture name was fixed. It was labled as Sandstone side rather than Sandstone normal.

- Log tops of All log block textures were changed to match the color of the matching wood plank block texture.
So now Logs can be used along side Planks in player builds as to have matching colors with a different texture.
Color of the bark on the side of Logs remain unchainged.
